# ball_balance
MECA 482 Controls System Ball Balance Project

Deliverables:
- The team expected to present their project (~5 mins) and build a web page which
contains all deliverables in Github.
- The mathematical model of the system must be delivered -preferably in Python or
MATLAB.
- The control system should be provided preferably in Simulink, state-flow, or with a highlevel programming language (C, C++, or Python). However, the team must show that the
control algorithm will give the design requirements for the target system. In other words,
one cannot build the system with solely a hands-on approach. (You can as more details
about this, if that is not clear.)
- The system should have a simulation with the control system and mathematical model.
- If the system contains hardware. The design of the hardware with the necessary
architectural explanation to elaborate the relationship between hardware and software
